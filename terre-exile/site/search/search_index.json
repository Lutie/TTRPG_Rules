Their relationships with outsiders tend to be selective: they are welcoming to those who show sensitivity to nature, yet distant or even playful-cruel toward those who do not.</p> <p>Unlike Dryads, who embody the stern, immutable laws of the forest, Nymphs represent its fluidity\u2014its charm, its illusions, its gentler yet unpredictable rhythms. They embrace sensibility, diplomacy, and intuition, making them subtle negotiators and enchanting speakers. Their playful nature, however, masks a keen intellect and a deep understanding of the emotional currents around them. Tensions with Dryads stem from these philosophical differences: Dryads see Nymphs as too indulgent and whimsical, while Nymphs find Dryads overly rigid and lacking in joy. Still, despite this rivalry, the two peoples stand united when nature calls for protectors.</p> <p>&lt;&gt; Nymphs possess the Echo of Emotion: any strong feeling expressed near them leaves behind a faint, temporary impression\u2014an echo\u2014visible only to their senses. These echoes take the form of glimmers, subtle colors, or vibrations in the air, allowing Nymphs to read emotional \u201ctrails\u201d left by others.

It does not affect tactics and defenses, which depends on their nature.</p> <ul> <li>Hilted Weapons (like swords): Weapons with a hilt are those whose handling requires great finesse and precision. The handle allows for quick and precise movements, necessary to strike specific targets or exploit opponent's weaknesses. For this reason, the main attribute for wielding these weapons is Dexterity (DEX). Dexterity reflects the fighter's ability to perform precise and coordinated movements, essential to getting the most out of grip weapons.</li> <li>Handled Weapons (such as axes): Weapons with handles are designed to inflict damage through brute force. The handle extends the reach of the weapon and increases the power of the blow thanks to the force applied. Effectively using a hafted weapon therefore requires considerable Strength (FOR). Strength influences the fighter's ability to lift, swing, and strike with the weapon, transforming muscular energy into devastating punching power.</li> <li>Shafted Weapons (such as spears): Shafted weapons combine extended reach with the need for quick, controlled movements, exploiting both the reach to keep the enemy at bay and the ability to deliver rapid blows . For this reason, the main attribute for these weapons is Agility (AGI). Agility determines the fighter's ability to manipulate the weapon with velocity and precision, allowing them to react quickly to the opponent's movements while maintaining a safe distance.</li> <li>Ranged Weapons (such as bows or rifles): Ranged weapons allow engaging the enemy from a secure position, utilizing accuracy and distance judgment. The primary attribute for these weapons is Perception (PER). Perception affects the fighter's ability to accurately assess the distance and movements of the enemy, ensuring that each shot is made with maximum precision. This allows the fighter to remain outside the immediate reach of the enemy while still being able to inflict effective damage.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"items/weapon_rules__/#particularities","title":"Particularities","text":"<p>Weapons may have particularities.
