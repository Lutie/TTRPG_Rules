# Additional Rules

## Inventory

Inventory space doesn't need to be tracked at all time. Its use should be reserved for cases where logic and/or common sense cannot determine whether or not a character is able to carry a particular quantity of equipment.  
Objects are measurable in bulck, which represents, depending on the case, the mass, the space or the precautions necessary for its transport.  
For a good representation of items not listed in those rules it is possible to refer to weapons and armor and make a quick comparison.  
For quicker reference: Very small items should take at least 0.5 bulck. Small item should take 1 bulck. Above 1 bulck are notable items.  
If total stored bulck is superior to Inventory Space then all throw are disavantaged.  
It is impossible to have twice its Inventory Space stored at one time.
