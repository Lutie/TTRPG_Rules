# Weapon Advanced Rules

<span style="color: red">Note: this list is not accurate, indicators should be different and size/width/balance should adjust weapon's indicators.
Also most of the weapon's rules have been changed so... everything here is outdated and should be reworked accordingly.</span>

## Indicators

A weapon have 6 indicators when used. Those indicators are used in various cases and are linked to an Attribute modificator of the user, serving as an ajustement to them.  
Indicators are only applied when the weapon is used for the given action.

| Name       | Attribute | Use                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Throw      | Weapon's  | Added to weapon's throw value                                                                               |
| Control    | DEX       | Compared to adversary's control to determine if user is not disadvantaged while using an opportunity        |
| Speed      | AGI       | Compared to adversary's speed to determine if user is not disavantaged while performing a subsequent attack |
| Sturdiness | STR       | Compared to adversary's sturdiness to determine if weapon takes one or two breaks (?)                       |
| Impulse    | RUS       | Added to weapon's initiative value                                                                          |
| Finesse    | PER       | Added to weapon's precision value                                                                           |

### Size

The size of the weapon is intricated with some of its indicators.  
Size is, without surprises, the measure of the weapon's lenght (compared to category standards).  
A weapon with a size of -1 is "short".  
A weapon with a size of 1 is "long".  
Otherwise it's "normal".

### Width

The width of the weapon is intricated with some of its indicators.  
Width is the measure of the weapon's thickness (compared to category standards).  
A weapon with a width of -1 is "thin".  
A weapon with a width of 1 is "thick".  
Otherwise it's "normal".

### Balance

The balance of the weapon is intricated with some of its indicators.  
Balance is the measure of the weapon's distribution of weights and shapes (compared to category standards).  
A weapon with a balance of -1 is "unbalanced".  
A weapon with a balance of 1 is "balanced".  
Otherwise it's "normal".

### Customization

The customization of the weapon is intricated with its indicators.  
Customization can be used to change indicator values.  
A weapon can be "slightly" customized, gaining a +1 to one indicator and a -1 to one another.  
A weapon can be "heavily" customized, gaining a +1 to two indicators and a -1 to two another.  
A weapon can be "fully" customized, gaining a +1 to three indicators and a -1 to all others (which should be 3).  
Otherwise it's "normal".  
Only players or rare crafters cares to create or modify weapons with customizations. It's a difficult and costly process.

## Functionalities

The vast majority of weapons are designed to be used equally in attack, defense or tartical uses.  
But some weapons are designed to be more efficient in specific cases, here's the variety which can be expected in this regard:

- **Classic** Weapons : Works equally in all cases.
- **Block** weapons : Those are mostly "shields", designed to be used in blocking defenses (for both defense and follow up action, here the counter tactical).
- **Parry** weapons : Those are mostly "parrying daggers", or "main gauche", designed to be used in parrying defenses (for both defense and follow up action, here the counter attack).
- **Tactical** weapons : Those are mostly "whips" and alike, designed to be used in tactical situations.

A weapon with a given none general functionality (block, parry or tactical) recieves a roll bonus on any success when used in its designed case.  
In all other cases the same none general weapon receives a roll malis, meaning a minor success doesn't grant one for instance.
