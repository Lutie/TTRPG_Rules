# Character progression

## Summary

A character may progress by accumulating experience points (XP).  
How much XP a character have defines his level and each time a level is acquired that character gets some path points (PP) and some skill points (SP).  
PP can be used to improve pathes rank while SP can be used to improve skills rank.
