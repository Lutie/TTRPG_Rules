### Dragon Powers
**Cost:** 1 PP.
**Description:** Drakkans carry within their veins a diluted echo of true draconic power. Dragons wield Chromatic Power directly through their dragon heart, an overwhelming and primordial force. Drakkans, by contrast, can only access a minute fragment of this power through their blood. This fragment allows them to invoke crude yet potent magical phenomena tied to a specific chromatic domain. While vastly inferior to true dragons in mastery and magnitude, this inherited magic remains distinct, instinctive, and difficult to counter by conventional arcane means.  
**Effect:** The character may have up to 5 + mEQU chroma points every day.
These points can be spent to invoke Chromatic Magic, a fast but simple form of magic.
As a simple action, once per turn, the character may produce a spell-like phenomenon based on a simple spell from the blood-related domain.
Most drakkan types are associated with a predefined set of domains. This choice is made at character creation and cannot be changed later.
Balance (EQU) is used to perform the test related to this action. A skill group and a skill can be learned to improve odds to perform this action.  
Chromatic powers may be casted at spell level up to 0, increased by +1 for every 4 character ranks.
Magical tools do not function properly with chromatic powers. However, the character may still add their rank to the spell throw as if using an appropriate tool, regardless of the spell's level.
The chroma point cost of a chromatic power is equal to the minimum mana cost of a comparable spell and cannot be reduced by any means. Same goes the action difficulty, which is also based on a comparable spell's difficulty.
Chromatic powers are not spells: They cannot be countered. They are not treated as regular spells. They are unaffected by arcane actions or effects that interact with spells.
Also, depending on the drakkan type, chroma points can be used as if they were a different ressource : Red/Rage, Blue/Chi, Green/Guard, Yellow/Adrenaline, Purple/Mana, Black/Vitality, White/Karma, Grey/Spirituality.
