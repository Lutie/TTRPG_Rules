# Characteristics

A character is defined not only by their core attributes but also by derived characteristics. These characteristics depend on the attributes, giving a more nuanced view of the character's strengths and weaknesses in specific situations.

## <u><b>Health levels</u></b>

Health levels represent both physical and mental resilience, split into two main resources: Vitality Points and Focus Points. These resources fluctuate based on the character's experiences and actions, influenced by specific attributes. Both resources are essential for a character's ability to persist through adversity, whether physical or mental, and depleting them comes at a high cost.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Vitality Points (PV)

Formula : Constituation's modifier.  
The Martial Archetype improves this resource as the rank increases.

Vitality represents a character‚Äôs physical endurance and their capacity to withstand harm or push their limits in extreme physical situations. Vitality can decrease from receiving heavy physical damage or be consumed voluntarily to achieve a critical boost in physical actions, allowing the character to succeed in dire moments.  
Considered as a ressource.

Use:

- Damage: Vitality decreases when the character sustains significant physical damage.
- Exertion: In critical moments, a character can consume 1 Vitality Point to gain a one-time +10 boost on a physical-aligned roll. This boost can make the difference between success and failure in extreme situations, though using Vitality this way is costly, as it‚Äôs akin to enduring substantial physical damage.
- Consequence of Reaching 0: When Vitality reaches 0, the character is ‚Äúdowned,‚Äù unable to perform physical actions and facing a disadvantage on all other actions, marking a state of severe physical incapacity.

### üíô Focus Points (PF)

Formula : Willpower's modifier.  
The Scholar Archetype improves this resource as the rank increases.

Focus reflects the character‚Äôs mental and emotional resilience. It represents the capacity to withstand intense intellectual, emotional, or social challenges, as well as the ability to fuel certain special abilities. Focus can decrease from mental or social trauma or be used to enhance mental actions in difficult situations.  
Considered as a ressource.

Use:

- Damage: Focus decreases due to social or mental trauma, referred to as ‚ÄúTrauma‚Äù within the game, which represents significant psychological or emotional stress.
- Exertion: In tough mental scenarios, a character can consume 1 Focus Point for a one-time +10 boost on a mental-aligned roll, aiding in overcoming particularly challenging tasks.
- Fuel for Abilities: Focus may also serve as fuel for certain special abilities, like a barbarian‚Äôs rage or other unique character skills, allowing them to tap into deeper core reserves.
- Consequence of Reaching 0: When Focus reaches 0, the character is ‚Äúsapped,‚Äù unable to perform mental actions and facing a disadvantage on other actions, reflecting a state of severe mental or emotional incapacity.

## <u><b>Ressources</u></b>

### üí° Astutness Points (PA)

Formula : Cunning's modifier.  
The Specialist Archetype improves this resource as the rank increases.

Astuteness represents a character‚Äôs ability to plan, assess, and strategically think through their actions before executing them. This resource allows the character to anticipate potential outcomes and prepare themselves for success by carefully calculating their moves, but it also may grant the little something that can turn a nearly failed action in a successfull one.  
Considered as a ressource.

Use:

- Before a Roll: A character can consume 1 Astuteness Point before a roll to gain a one-time +20 boost to the result, reflecting their clever calculation and planning.
- After a Roll: A character can consume 1 Astuteness Point after a roll to gain a one-time +5 boost to the result, symbolizing a quick reassessment or minor correction after seeing the initial result.
- Both boosts can be applied to a single tests by spending up to 2 Astuteness Point this way.

### üé≤ Karma Points (PK)

Formula : Luck's modifier.  
The Adventurer Archetype improves this resource as the rank increases.

Karma represents a character‚Äôs fortune and the unpredictable sway of fate in their favor. This resource allows the character to turn the tide of chance, reflecting the whimsical nature of luck itself.

Use:

- A character can consume 1 Karma Point to reroll a die, granting them another chance to change the outcome of a failed or less favorable result.

### üéØ Stratagem Points (PS)

Formula : Intelligence's modifier.  
The Intriguer Archetype improves this resource as the rank increases.

Stratagem represents a character‚Äôs tactical insight and adaptability, enabling them to correct or adjust their actions when things don‚Äôt go as planned. This resource reflects the character‚Äôs ability to recover from mistakes or adapt quickly, using their intelligence to steer the outcome in their favor.

Notes:

- Retry an Action: A character can consume 1 Stratagem Point to retry an action without any additional penalties, allowing them to correct an initial mistake or misstep.
- Attempt with Advantage: If the character justifies a clever approach, they can consume 1 Stratagem Point to try an action with advantage, representing a strategic adaptation or thoughtful planning.

### ‚ú® Energy Points (PM)

Formula : Wisdom's modifier.  
The Mage Archetype improves this resource as the rank increases.

Energy represents the character‚Äôs inner reserves of mystical or scientific power, enabling them to perform extraordinary feats beyond ordinary capabilities. This resource is essential for casting spells or operating advanced steam-powered technology, reflecting the character‚Äôs connection to either arcane forces or scientific ingenuity.

Notes:

- Casting Spells: A character consumes Energy Points to cast spells. The exact amount needed depends on both the spell level and the result of a spell-focusing skill check.
- Operating Steam Technology: Energy Points can also be spent to utilize complex steam-powered devices, allowing for scientific applications in place of magic.

Terminology:

- When used for magical purposes, this resource is often referred to as Mana Point (PM).
- When applied to steam technology, it may be referred to as Techno Point (PT).

## <u><b>Modifiers</u></b>

The modifiers correspond to particularities of the body or the mind of the character, these particularities do not allow actions to be carried out on their own but provide more details and imply different, significant advantages.  
Generally these particularities are inherited at birth due to belonging to this or that species.  
A positive modifier implies a balance and luck penalty of 3 per point, conversely a negative modifier implies a balance and luck bonus of 3 per point instead.

Values ‚Äã‚Äãless than -2 or greater than 2 are not associated with humanoids but exist in nature.  

### üí™ Stature

Stature reflects a character‚Äôs overall mass and physical bulk, representing how solid and broad they are. It defines their physical presence in terms of strength, weight, and robustness rather than height. A character with high Stature has greater body mass, which influences their stability and capacity to endure or apply force. This modifier generally ties back to their origins or physical build.  
Stature mostly depends on origins.

Have positive impact on:

- Grip, fortitude, body resistance, carry, impact.  
- Thougness (save).  

Have negative impact on:

- Pace (a greater bulk may slow down a bit).
- Initiative (save) (a greater bulk can make it harder to react quickly to sudden changes, slowing down reaction times).  

Values and Meaning:

- A value of 0 represents the standard human physique in this category. Example: Humans.  
- A value of -1 indicates a leaner, more slender build. Example: Elves.
- A value of -2 denotes a very thin or delicate physique, sometimes even frail. Example: Smaller beings like nymphs or halflings.
- A value of 1 represents a broader, sturdier build. Example: Dwarves.
- A value of 2 is associated with a massive, imposing frame‚Äîa ‚Äúwalking tank‚Äù. Example: Large feral races such as Urssians or Koddans.

### üìè Size

Size specifically relates to the character's height and reach, affecting their flexibility and the range of their movements. A taller character can cover more ground with their stride and reach targets more easily, which can be advantageous in certain scenarios. However, taller individuals might struggle more with balance, making certain precise maneuvers more challenging.  
Size mostly depends on origins.

Have positive impact on:

- Pace, reach, poise.
- Flexiblity (save).

Have negative impact on:

- Initiative (save) (a greater height can sometimes mean slower reflexive actions, especially in response to sudden, close-range threats).

Values and Meaning:

- A value of 0 represents the average human height and reach in this category. Example: Humans.
- A value of -1 indicates a shorter stature with reduced reach. Example: Dwarves.
- A value of -2 denotes a small or diminutive size, making the character particularly short. Example: Halflings or pixies.
- A value of 1 represents a taller-than-average height, with an extended reach. Example: Elves.
- A value of 2 is associated with very tall beings, possessing considerable height and reach. Example: Giants or large feral races.

### ‚öúÔ∏è Ego

Ego represents a character‚Äôs sense of self and confidence, as well as their resilience in social interactions. Characters with high Ego can withstand failures without losing self-assurance, enhancing their social standing and spiritual defenses. However, Ego can lead to arrogance, which may affect their fame and make them more susceptible to corruption.  
Ego mostly depends on origins.

Have positive impact on:

- Spiritual resistance.
- Panache (ability to hold one‚Äôs own in complex social exchanges).
- Sanctum (ability to handle stress through self-confidence and resilience).
- Bravery (save).

Have negative impact on:

- Fame (a strong ego can be perceived as arrogance).
- Equilibrium (Ego lacks stability, making the character more vulnerable to corruption).
- Initiative (save), as sometimes slowing immediate reactions in favor of self-assuredness or careful assessment.

Values and Meaning:

- A value of 0 represents a standard level of self-confidence and self-awareness. Example: Humans.
- A value of -1 indicates a modest or humble disposition, with reduced self-assertiveness. Example: Halflings.
- A value of -2 denotes a very low sense of ego, often resulting in self-doubt or deference. Example: Razzans or Luppans.
- A value of 1 represents a strong sense of self and confidence. Example: Elves.
- A value of 2 is associated with a highly assertive, even arrogant disposition. Example: Drakkans.

### üåü Aura

Aura represents a character's inherent magnetic or calming presence. It‚Äôs not about directly influencing others but rather about drawing people in, creating an atmosphere that makes others naturally gravitate towards or feel at ease around them. Aura is often subtle; it can make the character seem more intriguing or inviting, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily compel action or sway opinions. A character with a strong Aura is noticed and often remembered, yet they may rely on the social comfort this presence affords, which can make them more dependent on relationships for support.  
Aura mostly depends on origins.

Have positive impact on:

- Fame (magnetic personalities are inherently attractive and garner attention).
- Equilibrium (strong Aura can reflect purity, reducing susceptibility to corruption).
- Composure (save).

Have negative impact on:

- Sanctum (stress affects those more reliant on social support structures), Recovery (independent characters recover faster from injuries, while highly social characters depend on others and may struggle with self-reliance).
- Initiative (save), as character may be more attuned to the people around them than to sudden threats, leading to a slight delay in response.

Values and Meaning:

- A value of 0 represents a typical level of presence and social appeal. Example: Humans.
- A value of -1 indicates a more reserved or unassuming presence, which may cause others to overlook or even feel slightly irritated by the character. Example: Nekkans.
- A value of -2 denotes an aura that is either highly subdued (bordering on ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù) or noticeably off-putting, making the character socially ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù or mildly annoying to others. Example: Goblins.
- A value of 1 represents a naturally magnetic or intriguing presence that others find attractive and engaging. Example: Elves.
- A value of 2 is associated with an exceptionally captivating aura, almost supernatural in effect, drawing attention effortlessly. Example: Nymphes.

What is the difference between Aura and Charisma ?  
Charisma is the ability to actively influence, persuade, or inspire others. Unlike Aura, Charisma involves a more direct impact on people‚Äôs actions or decisions. Characters with high Charisma can motivate, convince, or even manipulate others, often commanding attention and respect through their words and actions. Charisma is the power to lead and change minds, while Aura is the natural attraction or warmth that might open the door for that influence.

## <u><b>Thresholds</u></b>

It serves as a ‚Äúroleplay safety net‚Äù for unnoticed details, granting a subtle sense of something amiss even when the character isn‚Äôt actively investigating. Intuition can alert the character to potential threats or unusual situations, prompting them to take action or investigate further based on this inner feeling.

Used:
