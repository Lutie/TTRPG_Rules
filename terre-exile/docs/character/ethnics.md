# Ethnics

## Rules

**Strong attributes**: List the attributes in which this ethnic excels. The player selects two of these attributes to receive a free boost.
**Weak attributes**: List the attributes in which this ethnic is naturally disadvantaged. The player may choose one weak attribute to voluntarily accept in order to gain one additional boost from the strong attribute list.
**Birth attributes**: List the variations of the secondary attributes for this ethnic. A valid set of birth attributes must have a total value of 60 or less—never exceeding this limit.
**Birth particularities:** This section lists all the particularities a character gains from their race. Some races share most, or even all, of these particularities — such as Humans, Elves, or Dwarves — while others differ more significantly. In some cases, a “race” is more a conceptual or semantic category than a strict biological lineage, which explains why shared traits may be limited.  
**Cultural particularities:** This section lists all the particularities a character gains from their ethnicity. Ethnic groups belonging to the same race usually follow a shared structural pattern in how these particularities are distributed, but the nature and meaning of those particularities can differ greatly from one culture to another. This content is what truly defines the identity and role of each ethnicity. For example, Human cultures express themselves through auras, Ferals through instincts and totem affinities, while Elves commonly manifest minor innate magics (cantrips). The framework may be shared, but the expression is fundamentally different. If a character is raised within a culture other than their birth culture, they may gain the cultural particularities of their adopted culture instead. This choice is always subject to the GM’s approval and should serve narrative and role-playing purposes, not mechanical optimization or min-maxing.

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/eldrazian-f-2.jpg">
</div>

This people, known as ebony elves or dark elves, have skin as black as jet. Dark elves present two faces: publicly, they work as troubadours, advisors, courtiers... In the shadows, they are spies, assassins, and mercenaries. Dark elves are not born with dark skin; they develop it when their dark heart awakens. The community of dark elves is managed by an organization based in secluded citadels, overseeing the affairs of their members. A dark elf without ties to these communities eventually succumbs to their dark heart.

Eldrazians, or Black Elves, are a rare and enigmatic subgroup, often born among other elves. Recognized by their dark skin and intense disposition, they are highly disciplined, but without guidance, they may become violent and uncontrollable due to an innate “black gene.” Éldraziens live in secluded citadels where they learn to master their nature through rigorous training. Skilled in stealth, combat, and subterfuge, Éldraziens are often hired by human nobles as assassins, but they also serve as musicians, artists, or poets to mask their true purpose.

**Skills:** Melee, Subterfuge, Spellcasting, Brawl, Discretion, Tactical, Manipulation, Athletics.  
**Personality traits:** Secretive, Calculative, Opportunistic, Disciplined, Intolerant, Critical, Ambitious, Stoic, Independent, Rebellious.  

**Strong attributes:** Dexterity, Cunning, Agility, Charisma, Magic

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/urganian-f-2.jpg">
</div>

This people, known by few and called as such as ruby elves or red elves, have skin as red and radiant as rubies. Red elves have ardent hearts and live life with passion. Their society is reclusive, little known, and quite secretive; for some, they are merely legends, while others see them as outcasts who chose seclusion over facing the consequences of their ancestors' actions.

Urganian Elves are reclusive, mystical, and fierce. They are known for their deep connection to magic and meditation, often adopting an austere, disciplined lifestyle that emphasizes self-control and focus. Unlike other elves, Urganians exhibit a strict, almost authoritarian attitude. Though rare, they are known for their strategic prowess in both magical and tactical domains. They are also skilled in persuasion and subtlety, often using their knowledge and experience to influence others indirectly.

**Skills:** Spellcasting, Melee, Tactical, Persuasion, Defense, Meditation, Erudition, Subterfuge.

### Half Elves

<div style="text-align: center;">

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/half-elf-f-2.jpg">
</div>

Half-Elves occupy a delicate place between two worlds. Neither entirely human nor fully elven, they often embody the best—and sometimes the worst—of both lineages. Their mixed heritage grants them remarkable adaptability, whether socially, magically, or physically, but also exposes them to mistrust from purist elven communities and suspicion from humans who see them as unpredictable.

Half-Elves do not form their own nations. Instead, they grow up within human or elven societies, inheriting the cultural environment of their parents. Because of this, no two Half-Elves are alike: some display the finesse and longevity of their elven lineage, while others lean toward human resilience and ambition. Many develop the ability to navigate between cultures with surprising ease, becoming diplomats, adventurers, scouts, or intermediaries in conflicts between humans and elves.

Their dual identity sometimes creates inner conflict, leading them either to wander in search of a place they truly belong, or to embrace their hybrid nature with pride. Half-Elves are often curious, adaptable, and perceptive, capable of learning quickly and excelling in roles requiring flexibility, negotiation, or creativity.

## Dwarf ethnics

### Bradanan

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/bradanan-m.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/bradanan-f.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/bradanan-m-0.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/bradanan-f-2.jpg">
</div>

Commonly called city dwarves, this dwarf people live very close to humans, who find them notably valuable due to their excellence in fields such as craftsmanship, technology, and management. Unlike their kin, the culture of Brandanan does not place much importance on their hair, so they often have smaller beards or mustaches, and sometimes are even clean-shaven. This is a source of humor for other dwarf peoples, who enjoy referring to them as gnomes rather than dwarves. But they nonetheless remain a robust and stubborn people who are rather reliable.

The Bradanan are dwarves who have assimilated into advanced human cities, thriving as engineers, craftsmen, and technologists. They are known for their pragmatism and adaptability in human-dominated environments, often bridging the gap between traditional dwarven skills and advanced sciences. Unlike other dwarves, Bradanan embrace innovation fully and distance themselves from mystical practices. They possess exceptional skill in ranged combat (e.g., throwing or shooting), technology, and various forms of crafting, making them invaluable assets in urban settings.

Also called Brandawis.

**Skills:** Craftsmanship, Technology, Persuasion, Erudition, Investigation, Negotiation, Shooting, Tactical.  
**Personality traits:** Hardworking, Disciplined, Conservative, Critical, Stubborn, Community-minded, Serious, Loyal, Patient, Modest.  

**Strong attributes:** Constitution, Perception, Intelligence, Logic

    __Perception__ – Their work in engineering, mechanics, and ranged weaponry requires constant vigilance and precision. Bradanan have trained senses, especially sight and hearing, essential for detecting flaws in machinery or structural weaknesses.
    __Intelligence__ – Integrating dwarven tradition with human innovation pushed Bradanan to adopt analytical thinking, planning skills, and scientific reasoning. They excel in technology, logistics, and complex problem-solving.
    __Logic__ – Whether crafting, designing machinery, or managing urban infrastructures, Bradanan rely on rationality and efficient structure. Their minds naturally break tasks into logical sequences, making them exceptional engineers and technologists.
**Weak attributes:** Agility, Charisma  
    __Agility__ – Like all dwarves, Bradanan retain a compact, solid build that limits speed and fluidity of movement. Their lives center around precision rather than mobility, reinforcing this natural physical limitation.
    __Charisma__ – Although reliable and competent, Bradanan tend to be blunt, overly pragmatic, or socially rigid. Their urban life has softened little of their dwarven straightforwardness, making them respected, but not always well-liked.
**Birth attributes:** Stature 11~12, Height 7~8, Ego 10~12, Appearance 8~10, Luck 10~11, Balance 10~11

### Karazdan

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/karazdan-m.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/karazdan-f.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/karazdan-m-2.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/karazdan-f-2.jpg">
</div>

The society of the Karazdan is generally perceived as the "main" society of this race, as it represents the overwhelming majority. It is divided into clans with distinct and diverse orientations. These dwarves have a notable culture of beards and similar attributes. Their braids and beard or hair decorations are marks of good taste and often say a lot about them, especially if they are paragons. Dwarves have no deities; instead, they refer to paragons, illustrious dwarves who have left a significant mark on their society in the present OR in the past and continue to convey notions that inspire current generations.

The Karazdan are the core ethnic group of dwarven society, representing the primary dwarven culture and lineage from which other clans draw their heritage. They live in rocky, hilly regions, practicing a robust lifestyle that emphasizes defense, mining, and physical endurance. The Karazdan who do not belong to specific clans are loyal to the High King, the central figure of dwarven sovereignty, whose authority unites the separate clan lords. Karazdan culture is rooted in loyalty, respect for tradition, and a strong emphasis on physical prowess, making them steadfast defenders of dwarven values.

Also called Karazdawis.

**Skills:** Craftsmanship, Melee, Defense, Endurance, Tactical, Athletics, Brawl, Mining.  
**Personality traits:** Hardworking, Aggressive, Fearless, Stubborn, Conservative, Community-minded, Imposing, Serious, Loyal, Resentful.  

**Strong attributes:** Willpower, Constitution + the ones associated to the choosen clan  
    __Willpower__ – Karazdan embody dwarven resolve: stubbornness elevated to a cultural virtue. Loyalty to their clan and High King reinforces their mental fortitude, allowing them to push through hardship without hesitation.
    __Constitution__ – Living in mountainous, subterranean, or hostile terrains has forged their bodies. Their lives revolve around mining, forging, fighting, and enduring harsh conditions, resulting in exceptional stamina and physical resilience.
    __Clan Attributes__ – Each clan cultivates its own strengths—strength, cunning, wisdom, leadership—rooted in their social roles and ancient traditions. These specializations refine the natural dwarven aptitude into purpose-built advantages.
**Weak attributes:** Agility, Dexterity, Charisma  
    __Agility__ – Karazdan physiques are dense and sturdy, built for endurance and power rather than mobility. Their heavy armor and tools further reinforce this natural limitation.
    __Dexterity__ – While precise in heavy craftsmanship (smithing, carving), they struggle with delicate manipulations requiring lighter or more flexible movements. Fine motor skills are often secondary to strength-based tasks.
    __Charisma__ – Karazdan dwarves are famously blunt, proud, and intense. Their fiery tempers, traditionalism, and social rigidity do not translate well to diplomacy, causing them to intimidate more often than they charm.
**Birth attributes:** Stature 12~13, Height 7~8, Ego 10~12, Appearance 7~9, Luck 10~11, Balance 10~11

### Ungordan

<div style="text-align: center;">

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/ungordan-m-2.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/ungordan-f-3.jpg">
</div>

The Ungordan are the dwarves of the depths, residing in vast underground cities carved into the heart of the mountains. These dwarves live far below the surface, in a world of perpetual darkness illuminated only by the glow of luminescent fungi and the forge fires of their cities. Their society is highly structured, with a rigid caste system that dictates every aspect of their lives.

Ungordan, also known as the Deep Dwarves, inhabit the underground depths known as the Tréfonds. Separated physically and culturally from surface-dwelling dwarves, the Ungordan have little in common with their kin above. In fact, they view surface dwarves as “deviants” or “denatured,” having lost their connection to the true dwarven way. The Ungordan excel in survival, tactical combat, and mining, navigating the dangerous tunnels and caverns with unmatched skill. They are known for their disdain of the surface and their emphasis on resilience and unity in the harsh, unforgiving depths.

Also called Ungordawis.

Ungordan Society:

- Deep Lords - At the top of the hierarchy are the Deep Lords, ruling from magnificent halls adorned with intricate stonework and precious gems. They govern the Ungordan with an iron fist, making decisions that affect the entire society.
- Artisans and Smiths - Skilled craftsmen who create the finest weapons, armor, and artifacts. Their work is highly valued, and they are respected for their expertise in metallurgy and stonecraft.
- Warriors and Guards - Trained from a young age, these dwarves defend the cities from the dangers of the deep, including monstrous creatures and rival factions. Their discipline and combat skills are unmatched.
- Miners and Excavators - The backbone of Ungordan society, these dwarves labor tirelessly to extract precious minerals and expand their subterranean realms. Their work is grueling and dangerous, but essential for the survival of their people.
- Merchants and Traders - These dwarves manage the flow of goods within the cities and trade with surface dwellers, though such interactions are rare and often fraught with tension. They play a crucial role in ensuring the cities are well-supplied.
- Servants and Laborers - The lowest caste, performing the menial tasks that keep the cities running. Despite their low status, they are an integral part of the Ungordan society.

**Skills:** Survival, Melee, Defense, Tactical, Endurance, Mining, Spellcrafting, Investigation.  
**Personality traits:** Stoic, Disciplined, Secretive, Conservative, Hardworking, Pessimistic, Cautious, Loyal, Serious, Unshakeable.  

**Strong attributes:** Strength, Constitution (x2), Willpower  
    __Strength__ – Life in the Tréfonds demands raw physical power. From mining colossal stone formations to fighting subterranean monstrosities, Ungordan dwarves possess unmatched brute force among their kin.
    __Constitution__ (x2) – Exposure to darkness, pressure shifts, toxic spores, cave hazards, and grueling labor hardened their bodies beyond even traditional dwarven standards. Their physiology adapted to resist poison, fatigue, and injury with extreme efficiency.
    __Willpower__ – The oppressive world below the earth can easily break weaker minds. Ungordan society cultivates strict discipline, emotional control, and mental toughness to survive the psychological toll of darkness and confinement.
**Weak attributes:** Cunning, Agility, Dexterity, Wisdom  
    __Cunning__ – Ungordan culture values obedience and communal unity over scheming or subtlety. Strict social conditioning suppresses individual trickery or personal ambition, weakening their capacity for manipulation or complex deception.
    __Agility__ – Years of living in heavy armor, navigating stone tunnels, and maintaining compact, muscular bodies restrict their fluid movement. Speed and flexibility are rare traits among Deep Dwarves.
    __Dexterity__ – While strong craftworkers, their work demands force rather than finesse. Fine manipulation, delicate handling, and light mechanical work suffer due to their heavy musculature and utilitarian mindset.
    __Wisdom__ – The isolation of the deep limits their worldview. Ungordan rarely experience spiritual diversity, natural landscapes, cultural exchanges, or contemplative traditions, resulting in a narrower understanding of the world and weaker intuitive insight.
**Birth attributes:** Stature 12~14, Height 7~8, Ego 10~13, Appearance 6~8, Luck 8~10, Balance 10~12

## Feral ethnics

The appearance of ferals is that of anthropomorphic animals. Depending on the individual, the propensity to which animal heritage is visible changes drastically.  
Some ferals have an appearance very similar to that of the animal they inherited.  
For others it is limited to a few visible features (ears, tails, etc.) and that's it.  
In terms of proportion, in Thalifen, we note among males a higher concentration of so-called "bestial" appearances and among women a higher concentration of so-called "human" appearances. In reality, there is everything in nature and males can have a very marked human appearance just as a female can have a very marked bestial appearance.

### Okkan (wolf-folks)

The Okkan are wolf-like humanoids who live in close-knit clan structures, much like wolf packs. Known for their wisdom and strong social bonds, they value loyalty, community, and cooperation. They are spread across the lowlands and are among the more sociable feral groups, often integrating well with other cultures.

</div>

These humanoids with cat-like traits are mischievous, playful, curious, and stealthy. They tend to avoid settling in societies of their own, preferring instead to integrate into larger human cities, where they can indulge their cunning and blend in with other cultures. They are quick-witted and agile, excelling in stealth and subterfuge, but are often perceived as untrustworthy due to their tendency to bend or ignore rules.
They are considered pacifist ferals who do not seek direct conflict.

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/onikkan-f-h.jpg">  
</div>

The Oni are cousins of the Okkans, humanoids with wolf features. Physically they are distinguished by a denser coat and/or darker tons.
As with the other so-called cursed ferals, they are touched by what some may describe as an illness which makes them associable at best, they therefore evolve little in society and when this is the case violence reigns supreme.

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/kitsune-f-h.jpg">  
</div>

The Oni are cousins of the Okkans, humanoids with fox features. Physically they are distinguished by the presence of multiple tails, particularly bushy, and by red tones.  
As with the other so-called cursed ferals, they are touched by what some may describe as an illness which makes them associable at best, they mosty never unit as a clan, driven by a personality focused exclusively on themselves.  
The evil that afflicts the Oni is curiosity and frivolity, nothing is really serious to them, not even life.

### Tengu (Raptor-folk)

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/tengu-m.png">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/tengu-f.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/tengu-m-2.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/tengu-f-2.jpg">  
</div>

The Tengu are bird-like humanoids who embody the darker, more aggressive aspects of their avian lineage. While the Garukkan exhibit sociability and pride, the Tengu embrace tenacity, independence, and cunning with a more ominous undertone. Known for their eloquence and intelligence, Tengu are highly self-assured, with a significant ego that often leads to isolation from others, even within their own kind. Unlike the Garukkan, who enjoy mingling with other societies, the Tengu view the world with suspicion and prefer to operate alone or in small, tightly knit groups.  
Tengu are natural predators, and some are known to resolve conflicts with lethal efficiency. Tengu society is loosely structured, lacking a true sense of community, as most members act according to personal codes of honor or vendettas. These dark, solitary beings are rarely seen in friendly terms with other cultures and are often feared or misunderstood for their ruthlessness and fierce independence.

**Skills:** Acrobatics, Detection, Athletics, Brawl, Finesse, Survival, Communication, Throw.  
**Personality traits:** Aggressive, Ambitious, Competitive, Fearless, Proud (Pretentious), Rebellious, Opportunistic, Energetic, Reckless, Independent.  

**Strong attributes:** Intelligence (x2), Perception, Cunning  
    __Intelligence__ (x2) – Tengu are sharp, analytical thinkers, obsessively dissecting tactics, grudges, and rivalries; their minds are honed for strategy and calculated conflict. 
    __Perception__ – As raptors, they possess razor-sharp sight and awareness, spotting weaknesses, movements, and distant targets with ease.
    __Cunning__ – Ambitious, competitive, and ruthless, Tengu are excellent strategists on a small scale—duels, ambushes, and personal vendettas.
**Weak attributes:** Constitution, Luck  
    __Constitution__ – Lean and built for speed rather than durability, Tengu do not handle prolonged punishment or attrition as well as sturdier ferals.
    __Luck__ – Their arrogance, reckless choices, and appetite for conflict attract retaliation and misfortune: they often create their own downfall.
**Birth attributes:** Stature 8~10, Height 9~10, Ego 10~12, Appearance 8~10, Luck 8~10, Balance 10~12  
**Allegiance:** Nature, Magic, Ankou, or None

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/razkkan-f-2.jpg">  
</div>

The Skaven are rat-like humanoids living in tunnels, ruins, and hidden areas. They are highly cunning and ruthless, with a society driven by personal gain and constant infighting. Known for their stealth, larceny, and survival skills, Skaven are adept at infiltration and scavenging, often using poisons, diseases, and crude technologies to their advantage. They rarely cooperate with others and are notorious for betrayal.

**Skills:** Larceny, Subterfuge, Occultism, Discretion, Detection, Urban Life, Investigation, Brawl.  
**Personality traits:** ?.  

**Strong attributes:** Agility, Cunning, Perception  
    __Agility__ – Razkkan skitter through ruins, sewers, and tunnels with ease, climbing, dodging and fleeing in tight, hazardous spaces.
    __Cunning__ – Their entire society revolves around schemes, betrayals, and self-interest. Every Razkkan learns to think crooked to survive.
    __Perception__ – Used to filth, darkness, and unstable environments, they are quick to notice cracks, sounds, movement, and exploitable details others miss.
**Weak attributes:** Willpower, Luck  
    __Willpower__ – Addiction to power, fear, and paranoia make them easy prey to domination, panic, or mass hysteria.
    __Luck__ – Surrounded by disease, collapsing lairs, treachery and dangerous experiments, Razkkan are almost cosmically unlucky—only their cunning keeps them alive.
**Birth attributes:** Stature 8~9, Height 6~8, Ego 10~12, Appearance 7~8, Luck 7~11, Balance 9~13

### Urssian (Grizzly-folk)

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/urssian.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/urssian-f-h.jpg">
</div>

The Urssian are a feral ethnicity similar to the Koddans, but with a more aggressive and violent culture. Known for their sheer physical strength and a social structure that values might above all, Urssians believe that power determines status and respect. They are often found in rugged, mountainous regions, where they maintain a life of endurance and combat readiness. Conflict and displays of dominance are central to their way of life.

**Skills:** Melee, Defense, Endurance, Athletics, Craftsmanship, Detection, Rural Life, Tactical.  
**Personality traits:** Stoic, Imposing, Aggressive, Loyal, Protective (Alert), Hardworking, Stubborn, Serious, Cautious, Resentful.  

**Strong attributes:** Strength, Constitution (x2)  
    __Strength__ – Urssians are walking siege engines: their physical might surpasses most ferals and allows devastating blows in combat.
    __Constitution__ (x2) – Their bodies are built to endure cold, injuries, and exhaustion. They can keep fighting, working, or traveling long after others fall.
    __Willpower__ – Their culture of dominance and endurance forges unbending resolve; once an Urssian commits to a course, turning back is rare.
**Weak attributes:** Luck  
    __Luck__ – Their culture of constant confrontation and dominance invites trouble—feuds, grudges, and brutal trials often stack the odds against them, even when they win.
**Birth attributes:** Stature 11~13, Height 12~14, Ego 10~12, Appearance 6~8, Luck 7~9, Balance 10~12

## Minor Feral ethnics

Not all animal breeds are represented in the rules because some of them represent the majority of existing individuals/declinations, but there are many more than that in nature corresponding to minorities scattered here and there. We will then speak of minor feral ethnicity and in these cases it is proposed to use the profile of an equivalent major ethnicity.  

| Ethnics   | Animal | Attributes           |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Pandarran | Panda  | Constitution, Wisdom |
| Raskkan   | Shark  | Stength, Cunning     |

Ethnicities without cultural and/or racial properties get 1 PP for each missing list (as if they had chosen the disadvantage that turns these lists into 1 PP each).

### Halfling

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/halfling-m.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/halfling-f.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/halfling-f-2.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/halfling-f-3.jpg">
</div>

Halflings are small folk gifted with a disarming youthful appearance that makes suspicion slip right past them. Their round faces, bright eyes, and lively manners suggest innocence—even when they are far from it. This lack of perceived threat is both a blessing and a curse: they avoid trouble easily, yet they are rarely taken seriously, even when they should be.

Living mostly among human societies—and, more rarely, elven ones—Halflings blend effortlessly into larger cultures, adapting to their customs while keeping their own traditions mostly unspoken. A long-standing rumor claims they have a homeland of their own, a hidden place of green hills and cozy burrows. Halflings themselves speak of it fondly, yet none can say if it truly exists. They were taught never to seek it, as if the myth itself mattered more than the truth; a story they cling to for comfort, identity, or perhaps something deeper.

Behind their cheerful faces lie sharp instincts for survival, negotiation, and quiet mischief—traits born from a life lived on the edge of obscurity.

**Skills:** Persuasion, Discretion, Acrobatics, Larceny, Survival, Negotiation, Finesse, Communication.  
**Personality traits:** Friendly, Playful, Optimistic, Curious, Resourceful, Homebound, Community-minded, Indulgent, Talkative (Loudmouth), Avoidant.  

**Strong attributes:** Dexterity, Agility, Cunning, Luck (x2)  
    __Dexterity__ – Small hands, nimble fingers, and a natural talent for subtle manipulation make Halflings excellent pickpockets, cooks, tinkerers, and lockbreakers.
    __Agility__ – Light, quick, soft-footed, and unpredictable, they move gracefully through crowds and tight spaces that larger folk cannot navigate.
    __Luck__ (x2) – Fortune truly seems to love them. Coin flips, daring escapes, risky gambles, and improbable coincidences routinely go their way.
    __Cunning__ – Their innocent appearances conceal quick thinking. Halflings understand people, twist situations to their advantage, and improvise solutions in charmingly sneaky ways.
**Weak attributes:** Strength, Constitution, Charisma, Willpower
    __Strength__ – Small stature means little raw power. They rely on agility and cleverness, not force.
    __Constitution__ – They are not built for hard labor, prolonged suffering, or harsh climates; they prefer comfort and safety.
    __Charisma__ – They are liked, yes, but not respected. Their childish looks and carefree manners make it hard for others to take them seriously.
    __Willpower__ – Halflings avoid conflict, trouble, and responsibilities. Their indulgent habits and reluctance to commit make them less resistant to manipulation or pressure.
**Birth attributes:** Stature 8~9, Height 6~7, Ego 7~10, Appearance 10~12, Luck 10~13, Balance 6~10

### Dryavid / Treefolks

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/dryad-m.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/dryad-f.jpg">

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/dryad-f-2.png">
</div>

Dryavids are beings of living wood and sap, guardians of secluded groves and ancient spirits. They coexist closely with Sylvanian elves, sharing values, culture, and an intimate reverence for the forest. While Dryavids understand elven society, they rarely partake in it fully, preferring the quiet sanctuaries hidden deep within the wilderness.

Their temperament contrasts sharply with that of their long-standing counterparts, the Nymphs. Though both peoples embody nature, they do so through very different philosophies. Dryavids are direct, unwavering, and at times uncompromising—living embodiments of the forest’s immutable laws. Nymphs, on the other hand, tend to be fluid, playful, charming, and subtly unpredictable.

This divergence often leads to a gentle rivalry: Dryavids view Nymphs as overly capricious and lacking discipline, while Nymphs see Dryavids as overly rigid and humorless. These tensions are rarely hostile, but they shape centuries of cultural teasing, disagreements, and competitive pride between the two races.

Despite this, when the forest is threatened, Dryavids stand among its fiercest protectors, wielding ancient strength and deep-rooted resolve.

Not to be confused with treants, which is a monstrous version of this people.

### Celestial

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/celestial-m.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/celestial-f.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/celestial-m-2.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/celestial-f-2.jpg">  
</div>

Celestials are radiant beings who dwell high above Thalifen on floating islands where order, law, and discipline form the core of civilization. They do not concern themselves with moral “good,” but rather with absolute order, which they see as the foundation of existence. Their society is rigid and structured, where every action is regulated and every transgression is a sacrilege.

Those who violate these sacred rules face exile—a punishment more severe than death for a Celestial. Most inhabitants of Thalifen have only ever encountered these exiles, for the Celestial realm remains almost entirely inaccessible to mortals. Even stripped of their status, exiled Celestials often retain the pride and aloofness of their people, viewing the world below as chaotic, primitive, and unbearably undisciplined.

Yet exceptions exist. Throughout history, a handful of Celestials have forged meaningful bonds with terrestrial peoples, such as the famed Alluren, whose exile aided the creation of Sylvengarde. Some Celestials, like the Valkyries, even allow themselves to be venerated by mortal cultures, acting as martial spirits or divine emissaries.

A Celestial’s presence commands respect, but behind their luminous beauty lies a mind shaped by strict doctrine—and a heart rarely given freely.

**Skills:** Spellcasting, Erudition, Defense, Tactical, Persuasion, Meditation, Leadership, Endurance.

### Fairies

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/faery-f-3.jpg">  
</div>

Fairies are graceful, winged beings roughly half the height of a human—slightly taller than Halflings yet far lighter. They are whimsical, capricious, and irresistibly curious, embracing life as a kaleidoscope of sensations and emotions. Their moods shift with the wind: playful laughter one moment, spiteful mischief the next.

Though often charming, Fairies are known for their volatile tempers and their notorious inability to accept defeat. A fairy scorned may unleash a cascade of pranks, illusions, or unsettling tricks—not deadly, but certainly memorable, and sometimes genuinely dangerous. The wrath of a Fairy, once provoked, can linger far longer than expected.

Their societies favor artistic expression, freedom, and the surreal logic of dreams. Fairies wander through forests and coastal regions, dancing between sunlight and moonbeams, shaping the world subtly with their magic. They are neither benevolent nor malevolent—merely true to their nature: emotional, impulsive, and endlessly enchanted by secrets and stories.

Not to be confused with pixies, which is a monstrous version of this people.

### Qunari

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/qunari-m.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/qunari-f.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/qunari-m-2.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/qunari-f-2.jpg">
</div>

The Qunari are a horned people known for their imposing stature and austere discipline. Their society follows a rigid doctrine called the Line, which teaches that every individual—regardless of strength, age, or rank—is responsible for maintaining the cohesion of the whole. Leadership among the Qunari is not fixed by birth or authority but granted temporarily to those whose competence best suits the situation, making their hierarchy fluid, adaptive, and surprisingly egalitarian.

Communities gather around large communal halls where decisions are made collectively through structured, ritualized debate. Endurance—physical, mental, and moral—is the cornerstone of Qunari identity. Emotional restraint is considered a form of wisdom, and their philosophy, although not a religion, holds that life gains meaning through discipline, clarity of purpose, and stability.

Qunari rarely assimilate into foreign cultures, which they often perceive as chaotic or lacking in foundational rigor. Still, individuals who struggle with the Line—or who simply seek a different path—sometimes abandon their homeland, becoming wanderers, mercenaries, or diplomats of circumstance.

Despite their stoic exterior, Qunari are not emotionless. They simply shape their emotions as they shape their bodies. Even those of frail build are expected to cultivate strength of mind and duty. Outsiders often misinterpret their seriousness as humorless solemnity, yet Qunari communities prize a form of ritualized irony: a dry, expressionless wit exchanged without smiles—both a cultural bonding tool and a subtle test of intellect. To most foreigners, this is as incomprehensible as it is unsettling.

<> Qunaris possess what scholars call the Memory of Iron: Their horn structure contains dense mineral fibers that subtly vibrate in the presence of emotional tension. Trained Qunaris can “read” these vibrations in others of their kin, sensing anxiety, aggression, hesitation, or determination without a word spoken.
This gives them exceptional synchronicity in combat formations and makes Qunari warbands notoriously difficult to outmaneuver.

### Nymphs

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/nymph-1.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/nymph-2.jpg"> 
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/nymph-3.jpg"> 
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/nymph-4.jpg"> 
</div>

Nymphs are nature-born beings traditionally associated with forests, rivers, and glades. Though admired for their elegance, they are far from the idealized figures depicted in human folklore. Their culture is shaped by duality: gentleness and mischief, serenity and volatility. Nymphs value emotional expression as much as Dryavids value structure, creating a longstanding cultural tension between the two peoples.

In Nymph society, decisions are taken through circles, communal gatherings where opinions are weighed not by authority but by persuasive ability—a trait they cultivate rigorously from youth. They cherish beauty not as ornament, but as a form of truth, believing that aesthetics reflect the inner state of beings and environments.

Though peaceful in appearance, Nymphs possess a sharp sense of pride and can react strongly to disrespect or broken promises. Their relationships with outsiders tend to be selective: they are welcoming to those who show sensitivity to nature, yet distant or even playful-cruel toward those who do not.

Unlike Dryavids, who embody the stern, immutable laws of the forest, Nymphs represent its fluidity—its charm, its illusions, its gentler yet unpredictable rhythms. They embrace sensibility, diplomacy, and intuition, making them subtle negotiators and enchanting speakers. Their playful nature, however, masks a keen intellect and a deep understanding of the emotional currents around them.
Tensions with Dryavids stem from these philosophical differences:
Dryavids see Nymphs as too indulgent and whimsical, while Nymphs find Dryavids overly rigid and lacking in joy. Still, despite this rivalry, the two peoples stand united when nature calls for protectors.

<> Nymphs possess the Echo of Emotion: any strong feeling expressed near them leaves behind a faint, temporary impression—an echo—visible only to their senses.
These echoes take the form of glimmers, subtle colors, or vibrations in the air, allowing Nymphs to read emotional “trails” left by others.
This makes them extraordinary mediators… and dangerously insightful antagonists.

### Trolls

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/troll-f-2.jpg">
</div>

Trolls are a nomadic horned people whose origins remain one of Thalifen’s cultural enigmas. The few records that mention them describe their arrival from the far southern reaches of the world—lands believed lost to Morvivance. Whether they fled, migrated, or simply wandered remains unknown even to them, as Troll oral traditions are fragmented and contradictory.

Troll society is defined by absolute personal autonomy. They acknowledge no chiefs, masters, or formal structures; authority is a foreign concept to them. Cooperation arises organically through mutual respect or shared goals, and conflicts are resolved through debate, contests of wits, or ritual duels intended to defuse tension rather than establish dominance.

Highly adaptive, Trolls travel in small caravans or as lone wanderers, guided by instinct and a deep cultural belief that stagnation is a form of death. Their craftsmanship is unexpectedly refined, often using unusual materials collected during their travels. Outsiders find them difficult to categorize: simultaneously contemplative and fierce, hospitable and aloof, unpredictable yet bound by a strong sense of personal honor.

Because so few Trolls have been seen in Thalifen, they remain shrouded in speculation, often romanticized or misunderstood by scholars.

<> Trolls wield the Pulse of Chaos, a dormant resonance within their blood inherited from their forgotten homeland.
This pulse reacts to powerful magic, emotional upheaval, or mortal danger, manifesting as flickers of colored light beneath their skin and granting them brief surges of instinctual clarity or strength.

## Semie ethnics

### Naggan

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/naggan-m.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/naggan-f.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/naggan-m-2.jpg">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/naggan-f-3.jpg">  
</div>

Naggan are serpentfolk descended from ancient lineages that once thrived behind the protective walls of Rosaï. They are recognized by their serpentine tails, shimmering scales, and calm, deliberate manner of speech. Though humanoid in stature, their physical and spiritual heritage ties them deeply to the forgotten age when Primordial Dragons still brushed against the world.

Their society was once divided into several clans—each distinguished by scale coloration and cultural tradition. Many of these clans were decimated when Morvivance reached Rosaï, scattering survivors across Thalifen. Today, Naggan communities are small, secretive, and often hidden within remote societies where mistrust follows them like a shadow.

Naggan culture venerates the Primordial Dragons not as gods, but as archetypes of cosmic principles. Each clan interprets this devotion differently: some through shamanism, others through martial discipline, mysticism, or oratory tradition. Although most Naggan now live isolated lives, the old customs endure in fragments—songs, scales dyed in ritual pigments, meditative dances, and cryptic proverbs referencing the "Silenced Wyrms."

Despite their enigmatic aura, Naggan are not hostile; they are contemplative and pragmatic, their worldview shaped by the belief that destiny coils and uncoils like a serpent, unpredictable yet purposeful.

Some of most known naggan's clan are:  
**Cindervale Clan** — Black and ember-red scales : A warrior lineage known for strict discipline and controlled rage. They viewed destruction as a path to renewal, echoing the Ashen Serpent’s teachings. Today, survivors wander as stoic mercenaries, bound by rigid personal honor.
**Glistenscale Clan** — Iridescent blue and green scales : Mystics and shamans who practiced water-based divination and dream-trance rites. They believe memories flow like rivers and that the Primordials still whisper through them. Many now live near coasts or waterways.
**Sandcoil Clan** — Gold and desert tones : Survivalists shaped by harsh environments, valuing patience, silence, and adaptability. Inspired by the Dune Wyrm, they mastered ambush tactics and desert navigation. Their remnants drift between remote desert communities.
**Verdancescale Clan** — Green and earth-toned scales : Diplomats, negotiators, and keepers of social balance. Their ritual debates followed spiral patterns symbolizing growth and resolution. They integrate more easily into forest societies, though still as outsiders.
**Lumenscale Clan** — White and pale lavender scales : Students of karmic flows, illusions, and hidden forces. Their insight is uncanny and often unsettling to others. They suffered greatly during Rosaï’s fall, leaving only scattered scholars and occultists.

Not to be confused with nagas, which is a monstrous version of this people.

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/centauran-f-2.jpg">  
</div>

Centaurans are an ancient semi-equine people whose culture blends warrior tradition with ritual wisdom. Proud and fiercely independent, they live in secluded forest enclaves where every aspect of life—craft, combat, diplomacy, even travel—is governed by elaborate customs passed down through long oral lineages. To outsiders, these customs often seem cryptic or overly formal, but to Centaurans they are the foundation of balance and honor.

Their society values strength of body as much as clarity of purpose. Centaurans rarely involve themselves in the affairs of other peoples, believing that most humanoids lack the discipline and respect necessary to navigate Centauran etiquette. Yet, when they choose to act, they do so with solemn conviction and strategic foresight.

Regarded as both protectors and omens by nearby communities, Centaurans maintain an aura of mystique. They act neither as sages nor savages—simply as guardians of their own path, bound to traditions older than most written histories.

### Undine

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/undine-f-3.jpg">
</div>

Undines are semi-aquatic beings shaped by ancient oceanic magic, capable of shifting their lower body between a sleek piscine tail and a pair of scaled, amphibious legs. This adaptation allows them to walk on land with surprising agility, though never without discomfort: Undines are biologically and psychologically bound to water. Without regular immersion or at least sustained contact with moisture, they grow anxious, then disoriented, and after a week of complete dryness, their bodies begin to fail.

Their underwater cities—grown from coral, living stone, and bioluminescent reefs—follow the principle of harmonic flow, a philosophy teaching that decisions must align with emotional and environmental currents. This gives Undines an air of serenity and contemplation, though their communication, rich in subtle gestures and shifts of “emotional currents,” often perplexes surface-dwellers.

While generally peaceful, they are not passive: Undines possess long memories and a wary eye toward land cultures. Some live as emissaries or negotiators between sea and shore, but most prefer the safety of their submerged sanctuaries, venturing onto land only with purpose—and always keeping a path back to the water.

### Drakkan

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/drakkan-black.jpg">

    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/drakkan-f.jpg"> 
    <img class="ethnics" src="../../images/ethnics/drakkan-f-h.jpg"> 
</div>

The Drakkan are descendants of ancient dragons whose origins stretch so far back in time that no living people can recount them with certainty. Their existence predates most written histories, and even the oldest traditions speak of them only in fragments—stories of great wyrms who once walked the world and left behind mortal offspring. Whether these dragons took physical form, shifted shapes, or begot children through more mystical means is unknown; what remains undeniable is that the Drakkan carry the unmistakable mark of dragonkind.

Recognizable by their horns, scaled skin, powerful physiques, tails, and vestigial wings, Drakkan embody the traits of the Primordial Dragons they descend from. Each lineage reflects the temperament of its progenitor: fiery ambition from Tiamat, resilience and wisdom from Prometheus, cunning fluidity from Leviathan, competitive energy from Aquilon, sharp insight or shadowed instinct from Bahamut, rigid justice from Chromium, or mystical intellect from Arcanum.

Their past is heavy. Long ago, Drakkan civilizations rose to frightening heights, driven by pride, power, or loyalty to their draconic blood. Their wars—sometimes among themselves, sometimes against other peoples—were so devastating that entire nations united simply to survive them. Though these conflicts are long gone, the memory persists. Many Drakkan today bear the burden of that legacy, living under suspicion or outright fear from other cultures.

Drakkan communities are rare and scattered. Some embrace ancient customs; others reject their heritage, attempting to build humbler lives far from the weight of legend. A few even try to restore a lost sense of honor, arguing that the sins of their ancestors should not define them. Yet everywhere they go, their lineage precedes them—respected by some, distrusted by many, and treated as living artifacts of an age forgotten.

The Primordial Dragons themselves have vanished, believed by scholars either dead, slumbering, or wandering worlds beyond reach. Drakkan grow up surrounded by tales of these forebears, though none can claim to truly know them. Still, denying the connection is considered foolish—perhaps even dangerous—for it is said that nothing angers a Drakkan more than mocking the truth they carry in their blood.

Ogrens are massive (gargantuan even) humanoids, descended from ancient ogres yet far more structured and civilized than their monstrous kin. Their imposing physiques, ritual markings, and sheer presence command attention. Though often perceived as brutes, Ogrens possess a practical, earthy intelligence shaped by survival rather than theory.

They inhabit harsh deserts and mountains, living in tight-knit clans centered around endurance, strength, and ancestral trials. To an Ogren, identity is earned through hardship: surviving the world is a rite in itself. While their past conflicts with other peoples have given them an intimidating reputation, those who look beyond their size discover a loyal, honest folk—remarkably skilled in stonecraft, forging, and pragmatic engineering.

Ogrens are towering survivors defined by durability and brute strength. Their weaknesses lie not in courage but in inner instability and a lifetime of hardship, reflected in low Balance and Luck.

Orkkans, sometimes called “half-orcs,” are a warrior people shaped by relentless environments and an even harsher history. Their powerful frames, pronounced tusks, and resilient skin speak of a life defined by struggle. In Orkkan society, adversity is not merely endured—it is honored. Strength, rivalry, and tenacity form the core of their culture.

Primarily nomadic, Orkkans travel across deserts, jungles, coasts, and underground territories, adapting with surprising ease. Their long-standing conflicts with humans have created mutual mistrust, passed down through generations. Yet Orkkans are far from mindless brutes: they possess a fierce sense of honor, deep clan loyalty, and a cultural respect for those who prove themselves through action rather than words.

Orkkans are fierce, fast, and durable, thriving in adversity. Their impulsiveness and tumultuous past diminish their Wisdom, Intelligence, and Luck, grounding them as proud survivors shaped by struggle.

Gablins, civilized cousins of monstrous goblins, are small, sharp-minded, and irrepressibly resourceful. Quick of hand and quicker of wit, they thrive in cramped alleys, bustling cities, and subterranean networks. Their society revolves around improvisation, cunning, and adaptability—traits that let them survive where others falter.

Although often mistrusted, Gablins maintain complex social structures based on extended families or craft-and-thief guilds. They excel in improvised engineering, erratic chemistry, stealth, negotiation, and the creative reinterpretation of ownership. Where something needs fixing, repurposing, acquiring, or quietly relocating, a Gablin is rarely far behind—usually grinning while doing it.

Gablins thrive on improvisation, speed, and cleverness. Their weaknesses stem from physical frailty and an inherently unstable inner nature, making them brilliant but fragile opportunists.

Not to be confused with goblins, which is a monstrous version of this people.

---

### Dragon Powers {#cult-dragon-powers}
**Cost:** 1 PP  
Drakkans carry within their veins a diluted echo of true draconic power. Where true dragons wield Chromatic Power directly through their dragon heart—an overwhelming, primordial force—Drakkans can only access a minute fragment of that power through their blood. This fragment allows them to invoke crude yet potent magical phenomena tied to a specific chromatic domain. Though vastly inferior to true dragons in mastery and magnitude, this inherited magic remains instinctive, raw, and difficult to counter through conventional arcane means.

**Effect:**  
Chroma Points granted by **Chromatic Blood** may be spent to invoke **Dragonic Powers**. These powers represent **Chromatic Magic**, a fast but simple form of magic distinct from spellcasting.

- As a **Simple Action**, once per turn, the character may produce a spell-like phenomenon based on a **simple spell** from the chromatic domain associated with their blood.  
- Most Drakkan types are tied to a **predefined set of domains**. This choice is made at character creation and cannot be changed later.

- A dedicated skill group and skill may be learned to improve the odds of successfully invoking these powers.  

Dragonic Powers may be used at **spell level 0**, increased by **+1 spell level for every 4 character ranks**.

Magical tools do not function properly with Dragonic Powers. However, the character may still add their **rank** to the power’s roll as if using an appropriate magical tool, regardless of the power’s level.

The **Chroma Point cost** of a Dragonic Power is equal to the **minimum mana cost of a comparable spell** and **cannot be reduced by any means**. The **action difficulty** is also based on that same comparable spell.

Dragonic Powers are **not spells**:
- They cannot be countered.  
- They are not treated as regular spells.  
- They are unaffected by arcane actions or effects that specifically interact with spells.

Depending on the Drakkan type, Chroma Points may alternatively be spent as if they were another resource:
- **Red:** Rage  
- **Blue:** Chi  
- **Green:** Guard  
- **Yellow:** Adrenaline  
- **Purple:** Mana  
- **Black:** Vitality  
- **White:** Karma  
- **Grey:** Spirituality
