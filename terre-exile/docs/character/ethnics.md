A dark elf without ties to these communities eventually succumbs to their dark heart.

Eldrazians, or Black Elves, are a rare and enigmatic subgroup, often born among other elves. Recognized by their dark skin and intense disposition, they are highly disciplined, but without guidance, they may become violent and uncontrollable due to an innate “black gene.” Éldraziens live in secluded citadels where they learn to master their nature through rigorous training.

They live in rocky, hilly regions, practicing a robust lifestyle that emphasizes defense, mining, and physical endurance.

The Ungordan are the dwarves of the depths, residing in vast underground cities carved into the heart of the mountains. These dwarves live far below the surface, in a world of perpetual darkness illuminated only by the glow of luminescent fungi and the forge fires of their cities. Their society is highly structured, with a rigid caste system that dictates every aspect of their lives.

Ungordan, also known as the Deep Dwarves, inhabit the underground depths known as the Tréfonds. Separated physically and culturally from surface-dwelling dwarves, the Ungordan have little in common with their kin above. In fact, they view surface dwarves as “deviants” or “denatured,” having lost their connection to the true dwarven way. The Ungordan excel in survival, tactical combat, and mining, navigating the dangerous tunnels and caverns with unmatched skill. They are known for their disdain of the surface and their emphasis on resilience and unity in the harsh, unforgiving depths.

## Feral ethnics

The appearance of ferals is that of anthropomorphic animals. Depending on the individual, the propensity to which animal heritage is visible changes drastically.  
Some ferals have an appearance very similar to that of the animal they inherited.  
For others it is limited to a few visible features (ears, tails, etc.) and that's it.  
In terms of proportion, in Thalifen, we note among males a higher concentration of so-called "bestial" appearances and among women a higher concentration of so-called "human" appearances. In reality, there is everything in nature and males can have a very marked human appearance just as a female can have a very marked bestial appearance.

This ethnic group of feral beings embodies the diverse and varied aspects of birds. They are tenacious and self-assured, characterized by a considerable ego and a generally noteworthy eloquence. These beings readily integrate into human cultures, where they enjoy a certain renown, both for their noble appearance and their aptitude for sociability.

As a result, their numbers are few, and this is not likely to change soon. Among them, some are pacifists, while others, more akin to raptors, are predators who do not hesitate to resolve personal conflicts with bloodshed.
