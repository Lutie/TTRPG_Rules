# Pathes

## Career

A career is defined by the array of a character's pathes.  
One character may have:

- 1x Racial path, imposed by character's origins
- 1x Ethnical path, imposed by character's background
- 1x Archetype path
- 3x Specialisation path
- 1x Organization path

## Racial Path

Grants access to the unique talents which can be developped because of the character's race.

- This can never be retrained, because race cannot (in most case) be changed.

## Cultural Pathes

Grants access to the unique talents which can be developped because of years past in a given culture.  
Character may have a different ethnical path than its real ethnic, it depends where the character spent most of his youth or previous lifetime, but in this case his progression will be **limited** in this case.

- This can be retrained if the character spend a lot of time in a different ethnical environement/culture.

## Archetype Pathes

Grants access to the unique talents which can be developped because of a given profession archetype.  
There is few archetypes but those serves as a bacon for the game balance.

- This can be retrained if the character spend a time to learn a different way.

## Specialisation Pathes

Grants access to the unique talents which incarnate very specific methods and abilities.  
Characters starts with acces to three of those pathes but he may have more than that later on.

- This can be retrained if the character spend a time to learn a different methods.

## Organization Pathes

Grants access to the unique talents which can be developped because character is associated to a given group.  
Character may learn the path of an organization without being one of their ranks, but his progression will be **limited** in this case.

- This can be retrained if the character spend a time to learn a different methods.
