They incorporate magic into daily life—from construction to agriculture—and are known for their powerful mage academies, which produce elite magic-users. Selunians are relatively rare, and although they have few true settlements, they exert significant influence in certain human kingdoms, particularly in politics and the military.

They are excellent swimmers.\n\nThalassians are water-oriented elves who feel at home near rivers, lakes, and oceans. Known for their agility and adaptability, they are skilled in navigation and swimming, sometimes creating underwater cities through magic. Thalassians are also natural traders, using their aquatic skills to establish strong commercial connections. Their craftsmanship often involves materials from the sea, like shells and coral, and they are effective negotiators. They're found mainly in coastal areas, occasionally forming communities on the water itself.",

These dwarves live far below the surface, in a world of perpetual darkness illuminated only by the glow of luminescent fungi and the forge fires of their cities. Their society is highly structured, with a rigid caste system that dictates every aspect of their lives.\n\nUngordan, also known as the Deep Dwarves, inhabit the underground depths known as the Tréfonds. Separated physically and culturally from surface-dwelling dwarves, the Ungordan have little in common with their kin above. In fact, they view surface dwarves as “deviants” or “denatured,” having lost their connection to the true dwarven way. The Ungordan excel in survival, tactical combat, and mining, navigating the dangerous tunnels and caverns with unmatched skill. They are known for their disdain of the surface and their emphasis on resilience and unity in the harsh, unforgiving depths.\n\nAlso called Ungordawis.\n\nUngordan Society:\n\n- Deep Lords - At the top of the hierarchy are the Deep Lords, ruling from magnificent halls adorned with intricate stonework and precious gems. They govern the Ungordan with an iron fist, making decisions that affect the entire society.\n\n- Artisans and Smiths - Skilled craftsmen who create the finest weapons, armor, and artifacts. Their work is highly valued, and they are respected for their expertise in metallurgy and stonecraft.\n\n- Warriors and Guards - Trained from a young age, these dwarves defend the cities from the dangers of the deep, including monstrous creatures and rival factions. Their discipline and combat skills are unmatched.\n\n- Miners and Excavators - The backbone of Ungordan society, these dwarves labor tirelessly to extract precious minerals and expand their subterranean realms. Their work is grueling and dangerous, but essential for the survival of their people.\n\n- Merchants and Traders - These dwarves manage the flow of goods within the cities and trade with surface dwellers, though such interactions are rare and often fraught with tension. They play a crucial role in ensuring the cities are well-supplied.\n\n- Servants and Laborers - The lowest caste, performing the menial tasks that keep the cities running. Despite their low status, they are an integral part of the Ungordan society.",

Known for their eloquence and intelligence, Tengu are highly self-assured, with a significant ego that often leads to isolation from others, even within their own kind. Unlike the Garukkan, who enjoy mingling with other societies, the Tengu view the world with suspicion and prefer to operate alone or in small, tightly knit groups.\n\nTengu are natural predators, and some are known to resolve conflicts with lethal efficiency. Tengu society is loosely structured, lacking a true sense of community, as most members act according to personal codes of honor or vendettas. These dark, solitary beings are rarely seen in friendly terms with other cultures and are often feared or misunderstood for their ruthlessness and fierce independence.",

A long-standing rumor claims they have a homeland of their own, a hidden place of green hills and cozy burrows. Halflings themselves speak of it fondly, yet none can say if it truly exists. They were taught never to seek it, as if the myth itself mattered more than the truth; a story they cling to for comfort, identity, or perhaps something deeper.\n\nBehind their cheerful faces lie sharp instincts for survival, negotiation, and quiet mischief—traits born from a life lived on the edge of obscurity.",

Though both peoples embody nature, they do so through very different philosophies. Dryavids are direct, unwavering, and at times uncompromising—living embodiments of the forest's immutable laws. Nymphs, on the other hand, tend to be fluid, playful, charming, and subtly unpredictable.\n\nThis divergence often leads to a gentle rivalry: Dryavids view Nymphs as overly capricious and lacking discipline, while Nymphs see Dryavids as overly rigid and humorless. These tensions are rarely hostile, but they shape centuries of cultural teasing, disagreements, and competitive pride between the two races.\n\nDespite this, when the forest is threatened, Dryavids stand among its fiercest protectors, wielding ancient strength and deep-rooted resolve.\n\nNot to be confused with treants, which is a monstrous version of this people.",

They do not concern themselves with moral “good,” but rather with absolute order, which they see as the foundation of existence. Their society is rigid and structured, where every action is regulated and every transgression is a sacrilege.\n\nThose who violate these sacred rules face exile—a punishment more severe than death for a Celestial. Most inhabitants of Thalifen have only ever encountered these exiles, for the Celestial realm remains almost entirely inaccessible to mortals. Even stripped of their status, exiled Celestials often retain the pride and aloofness of their people, viewing the world below as chaotic, primitive, and unbearably undisciplined.\n\nYet exceptions exist. Throughout history, a handful of Celestials have forged meaningful bonds with terrestrial peoples, such as the famed Alluren, whose exile aided the creation of Sylvengarde. Some Celestials, like the Valkyries, even allow themselves to be venerated by mortal cultures, acting as martial spirits or divine emissaries.\n\nA Celestial's presence commands respect, but behind their luminous beauty lies a mind shaped by strict doctrine—and a heart rarely given freely.",

The wrath of a Fairy, once provoked, can linger far longer than expected.\n\nTheir societies favor artistic expression, freedom, and the surreal logic of dreams.

    "description": "The Qunari are a horned people known for their imposing stature and austere discipline. Their society follows a rigid doctrine called the Line, which teaches that every individual—regardless of strength, age, or rank—is responsible for maintaining the cohesion of the whole. Leadership among the Qunari is not fixed by birth or authority but granted temporarily to those whose competence best suits the situation, making their hierarchy fluid, adaptive, and surprisingly egalitarian.\n\nCommunities gather around large communal halls where decisions are made collectively through structured, ritualized debate. Endurance—physical, mental, and moral—is the cornerstone of Qunari identity. Emotional restraint is considered a form of wisdom, and their philosophy, although not a religion, holds that life gains meaning through discipline, clarity of purpose, and stability.\n\nQunari rarely assimilate into foreign cultures, which they often perceive as chaotic or lacking in foundational rigor. Still, individuals who struggle with the Line—or who simply seek a different path—sometimes abandon their homeland, becoming wanderers, mercenaries, or diplomats of circumstance.\n\nDespite their stoic exterior, Qunari are not emotionless. They simply shape their emotions as they shape their bodies. Even those of frail build are expected to cultivate strength of mind and duty. Outsiders often misinterpret their seriousness as humorless solemnity, yet Qunari communities prize a form of ritualized irony: a dry, expressionless wit exchanged without smiles—both a cultural bonding tool and a subtle test of intellect. To most foreigners, this is as incomprehensible as it is unsettling.\n\nThis gives them exceptional synchronicity in combat formations and makes Qunari warbands notoriously difficult to outmaneuver.",

Though admired for their elegance, they are far from the idealized figures depicted in human folklore. Their culture is shaped by duality: gentleness and mischief, serenity and volatility. Nymphs value emotional expression as much as Dryavids value structure, creating a longstanding cultural tension between the two peoples.\n\nIn Nymph society, decisions are taken through circles, communal gatherings where opinions are weighed not by authority but by persuasive ability—a trait they cultivate rigorously from youth. They cherish beauty not as ornament, but as a form of truth, believing that aesthetics reflect the inner state of beings and environments.\n\nThough peaceful in appearance, Nymphs possess a sharp sense of pride and can react strongly to disrespect or broken promises. Their relationships with outsiders tend to be selective: they are welcoming to those who show sensitivity to nature, yet distant or even playful-cruel toward those who do not.\n\nUnlike Dryavids, who embody the stern, immutable laws of the forest, Nymphs represent its fluidity—its charm, its illusions, its gentler yet unpredictable rhythms. They embrace sensibility, diplomacy, and intuition, making them subtle negotiators and enchanting speakers. Their playful nature, however, masks a keen intellect and a deep understanding of the emotional currents around them.\n\nTensions with Dryavids stem from these philosophical differences:\n\nDryavids see Nymphs as too indulgent and whimsical, while Nymphs find Dryavids overly rigid and lacking in joy. Still, despite this rivalry, the two peoples stand united when nature calls for protectors.\n\nThese echoes take the form of glimmers, subtle colors, or vibrations in the air, allowing Nymphs to read emotional “trails” left by others.\n\nThis makes them extraordinary mediators… and dangerously insightful antagonists.",

    "description": "Trolls are a nomadic horned people whose origins remain one of Thalifen's cultural enigmas. The few records that mention them describe their arrival from the far southern reaches of the world—lands believed lost to Morvivance. Whether they fled, migrated, or simply wandered remains unknown even to them, as Troll oral traditions are fragmented and contradictory.\n\nTroll society is defined by absolute personal autonomy. They acknowledge no chiefs, masters, or formal structures; authority is a foreign concept to them. Cooperation arises organically through mutual respect or shared goals, and conflicts are resolved through debate, contests of wits, or ritual duels intended to defuse tension rather than establish dominance.\n\nHighly adaptive, Trolls travel in small caravans or as lone wanderers, guided by instinct and a deep cultural belief that stagnation is a form of death. Their craftsmanship is unexpectedly refined, often using unusual materials collected during their travels. Outsiders find them difficult to categorize: simultaneously contemplative and fierce, hospitable and aloof, unpredictable yet bound by a strong sense of personal honor.\n\nBecause so few Trolls have been seen in Thalifen, they remain shrouded in speculation, often romanticized or misunderstood by scholars.\n\nThis pulse reacts to powerful magic, emotional upheaval, or mortal danger, manifesting as flickers of colored light beneath their skin and granting them brief surges of instinctual clarity or strength.",

They are recognized by their serpentine tails, shimmering scales, and calm, deliberate manner of speech. Though humanoid in stature, their physical and spiritual heritage ties them deeply to the forgotten age when Primordial Dragons still brushed against the world.\n\nTheir society was once divided into several clans—each distinguished by scale coloration and cultural tradition. Many of these clans were decimated when Morvivance reached Rosaï, scattering survivors across Thalifen. Today, Naggan communities are small, secretive, and often hidden within remote societies where mistrust follows them like a shadow.\n\nNaggan culture venerates the Primordial Dragons not as gods, but as archetypes of cosmic principles. Each clan interprets this devotion differently: some through shamanism, others through martial discipline, mysticism, or oratory tradition. Although most Naggan now live isolated lives, the old customs endure in fragments—songs, scales dyed in ritual pigments, meditative dances, and cryptic proverbs referencing the \"Silenced Wyrms.\"\n\nDespite their enigmatic aura, Naggan are not hostile; they are contemplative and pragmatic, their worldview shaped by the belief that destiny coils and uncoils like a serpent, unpredictable yet purposeful.\n\nSome of most known naggan's clan are:",

To outsiders, these customs often seem cryptic or overly formal, but to Centaurans they are the foundation of balance and honor.\n\nTheir society values strength of body as much as clarity of purpose. Centaurans rarely involve themselves in the affairs of other peoples, believing that most humanoids lack the discipline and respect necessary to navigate Centauran etiquette. Yet, when they choose to act, they do so with solemn conviction and strategic foresight.\n\nRegarded as both protectors and omens by nearby communities, Centaurans maintain an aura of mystique. They act neither as sages nor savages—simply as guardians of their own path, bound to traditions older than most written histories.\n\nNot to be confused with centaurs, which is a monstrous version of this people.",

This adaptation allows them to walk on land with surprising agility, though never without discomfort: Undines are biologically and psychologically bound to water. Without regular immersion or at least sustained contact with moisture, they grow anxious, then disoriented, and after a week of complete dryness, their bodies begin to fail.\n\nTheir underwater cities—grown from coral, living stone, and bioluminescent reefs—follow the principle of harmonic flow, a philosophy teaching that decisions must align with emotional and environmental currents. This gives Undines an air of serenity and contemplation, though their communication, rich in subtle gestures and shifts of “emotional currents,” often perplexes surface-dwellers.\n\nWhile generally peaceful, they are not passive: Undines possess long memories and a wary eye toward land cultures. Some live as emissaries or negotiators between sea and shore, but most prefer the safety of their submerged sanctuaries, venturing onto land only with purpose—and always keeping a path back to the water.",

Their existence predates most written histories, and even the oldest traditions speak of them only in fragments—stories of great wyrms who once walked the world and left behind mortal offspring. Whether these dragons took physical form, shifted shapes, or begot children through more mystical means is unknown; what remains undeniable is that the Drakkan carry the unmistakable mark of dragonkind.\n\nRecognizable by their horns, scaled skin, powerful physiques, tails, and vestigial wings, Drakkan embody the traits of the Primordial Dragons they descend from. Each lineage reflects the temperament of its progenitor: fiery ambition from Tiamat, resilience and wisdom from Prometheus, cunning fluidity from Leviathan, competitive energy from Aquilon, sharp insight or shadowed instinct from Bahamut, rigid justice from Chromium, or mystical intellect from Arcanum.\n\nTheir past is heavy. Long ago, Drakkan civilizations rose to frightening heights, driven by pride, power, or loyalty to their draconic blood. Their wars—sometimes among themselves, sometimes against other peoples—were so devastating that entire nations united simply to survive them. Though these conflicts are long gone, the memory persists. Many Drakkan today bear the burden of that legacy, living under suspicion or outright fear from other cultures.\n\nDrakkan communities are rare and scattered. Some embrace ancient customs; others reject their heritage, attempting to build humbler lives far from the weight of legend. A few even try to restore a lost sense of honor, arguing that the sins of their ancestors should not define them. Yet everywhere they go, their lineage precedes them—respected by some, distrusted by many, and treated as living artifacts of an age forgotten.\n\nThe Primordial Dragons themselves have vanished, believed by scholars either dead, slumbering, or wandering worlds beyond reach. Drakkan grow up surrounded by tales of these forebears, though none can claim to truly know them. Still, denying the connection is considered foolish—perhaps even dangerous—for it is said that nothing angers a Drakkan more than mocking the truth they carry in their blood.",

To an Ogren, identity is earned through hardship: surviving the world is a rite in itself. While their past conflicts with other peoples have given them an intimidating reputation, those who look beyond their size discover a loyal, honest folk—remarkably skilled in stonecraft, forging, and pragmatic engineering.\n\nOgrens are towering survivors defined by durability and brute strength. Their weaknesses lie not in courage but in inner instability and a lifetime of hardship, reflected in low Balance and Luck.\n\nNot to be confused with ogre, which is a monstrous version of this people.",
